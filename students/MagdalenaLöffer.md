## A text about me

As requested in `exercise-1`, I will now add a little text about myself (with some delay) to practice markdown and working with git. I hope that whoever reads this might join, so I am not the only one to introduce myself. :)  
(Note that you have to add .md at the end of your filename to get a markdown file.)

## Who am I?

That question is far to philosophical to be answered here, I guess, but to answer it the ordinary way: I am a linguistics student who is (obviously) interested in languages, but also music, dancing, (vegetarian) food, books, nature, yoga...

## What is my programming experience?
I only entered the _world of programming_ last semester, when I took a introductory [python course](https://lfuonline.uibk.ac.at/public/lfuonline_lv.details?sem_id_in=21S&lvnr_id_in=198801). Even though it was quite tough and overwhelming at the beginning, I really enjoyed it; not only because have I learned so much about Pyhton and programming in general since then, but also because it completely changed the way I see computers/applications/webpages etc. I just think it is fascinating what is possible with just a few lines of code. If you are somewhat interested in programming, have a bit of time, I highly recommend watching [this stunning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQXXMycJwlM) about the art of code. You won't regret it, I promise! :)

I wish you all the best!
